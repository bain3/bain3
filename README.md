**Hello!** I am a computer science student who highly values privacy and OSS.
Feel free to check out my E2EE file sharing website [f.bain](https://f.bain.cz/),
or some of my other work. Any good stuff I make will sooner or later
end up on here. I also have a [personal git](https://git.bain.cz/) for projects 
that just don't need the discoverability, or fancy GitHub features.

You can contact me on matrix `@bain:nolog.chat`, [twitter](https://twitter.com/bain3_), 
or through other means listed on my [website](https://bain.cz/).
