**Hello!** I am a computer science student who highly values privacy and OSS.
Feel free to check out my E2EE file sharing website [f.bain](https://f.bain.cz/),
or some of my other work. Any good stuff I make will sooner or later
end up on here. Some of my other work lives on [code.nolog.cz](https://code.nolog.cz/bain).

You can contact me on matrix `@bain:nolog.chat`, [twitter](https://twitter.com/bain3_),
